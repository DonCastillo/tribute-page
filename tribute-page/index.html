            <p><b>Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</b> was a Filipino nationalist and polymath who became one of the icons of the late 19th century when the Philippines was still under the Spanish rule. Dubbed as the Philippines' national hero, he led La Liga Filipina, a secret organization aimed to unite the whole country against the injustices and violence perpetrated by the Spanish Government. He was a known reformist whose writings center on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom specifically rights for the Filipino people.</p>
